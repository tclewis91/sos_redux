          <p> 2. Don't Freak the Fuck Out--aka don't start screaming and limit movement </p>
          <p> 3. If you're wearing skinny jeans or other tight hipster shit remove them</p>
          <p> 4. Let that fucker bleed for 1/2 a minute then dress it</p>
          <p> 5. Keep track of your vitals and your symptoms (if you can see three of your partner that's bad)</p>
